                    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). Coming from Vietnam—a beautiful country in Southeast Asia—I’ve always been passionate about both sports and technology. Growing up as a sporty boy, I developed a strong love for football, which remains a big part of my life. At the same time, my curiosity for computers and technology has driven me to explore how they shape the world around us, inspiring my journey into IT.</p>

                    <h2>About this website</h2><br>
                    <p class="para">In this website, I will take you through my personal journey with technology—looking back at how my interests first began, the experiences that have shaped my path so far, and the vision I hold for the future as I continue to grow in the world of IT. To bring this journey to life, I have created the site using HTML and CSS, which not only showcase my story but also demonstrate the web development skills I am building as an IT student. The website is organized into four main pages: the Home page, which provides an introduction and welcomes visitors; the Past page, where I share how my passion for technology first began and the key moments that influenced me; the Future page, where I outline my aspirations and goals in the IT field; and the Comments page, which serves as a technical overview, providing information about the website’s overall structure and the CSS styles applied. Each page plays a different role, but together they create a complete and cohesive story of my journey in technology.</p>
