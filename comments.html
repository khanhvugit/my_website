                    <p>This website tells the story of my journey in computing. It is made up of four pages that share a little about me and my experiences, supported by a stylesheet to improve the look and feel, and images to make the stories more engaging. Here is a diagram that shows how my website is structured:</p><br>

                            <li>Grid: grid is used to create 2x2 layout for my photos.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    </div>
                    <p>Overall, using the combination of flexbox and grid creates a clean, balanced and responsive layout that makes the website easy to navigate and visually engaging.</p><br><br>
                    <h3>2. Colors</h3><br>
                    <p>These are the colors I used for this website:</p>
                    <img id="palette" src="images/colorpalette.png" title="My color" alt="This is the color palette for my website">
                    <div class="indent">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Background: I want the background to have a dark shade so it looks mysterious and highlights the contrast.</li>
                            <li>Interactive elements: Buttons use Blueviolet to highlight active.</li>
                            <li>Text: I choose the white color for texts and gold for headings to make them readable against the dark background.</li>
                            <li>Header and footer: They both have gradient background (deeppink, rebeccapurple, cyan for the header; dark red and navy for the footer) to add the vibrancy and make the page dynamic and modern.</li>
                        </ul><br><br>
                    </div>
                    <h3>3. Fonts</h3><br>
                    <p>I have chosen Rajdhani and Roboto fonts for this website.</p><br>
                    <div class="indent">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rajdhani: Used for the navigation menu and the heading 1 to make the web pages look "tech" and mysterious.</li>
                            <li>Roboto: Used for the texts to make them clear and easy to read.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    </div>
                    <p>The pairing of Rajdhani and Roboto creates a clear hierarchy: Rajdhani for standout titles/menus and Roboto for smooth reading in paragraphs.</p><br><br>
                    <h3>4. Additional features</h3><br>
                    <div class="indent">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Border of buttons: Rounded corners make soften the design of the page.</li>
                            <li>Responsive width: Using clamp makes the photo sizable depending on the screen size of the user.</li>
                            <li>Tables: I use the aqua color to make it outstanding.</li>
                        </ul><br><br>
                    </div>
                    <h3>5. Why I chose this Aesthetics</h3><br>
                    <p>I chose this style because I like a design that feels organized yet mysterious, which is why I used a dark colour palette as the base. The deep tones create intrigue, while bright accents and hover effects highlight key elements. Using flexbox and grid keeps everything structured and neat, reflecting my preference for clarity within a dark, elegant theme.</p><br><br>
                </div>
                <h2>V. Accessibility</h2><br><br>
                <div class="indent">
                    <h3>1. The &lt;alt&gt; tag</h3><br>
                    <p>The &lt;alt&gt; tag is used to show the content of images in my website. Also, with the &lt;alt&gt; tag, screen reader can describe the images to visually impaired users. Moreover, search engines also use the &lt;alt&gt; tag to improve the website's discoverability. All meaningful images have a descriptive &lt;alt&gt; tag. When users hover mouse over the images, the image title will appear.</p><br><br>
                    <h3>2. Font choices</h3><br>
                    <p>Body text uses Roboto at comfortable sizes and line height on a dark background. I chose Roboto because it is a modern, san-serif font that is readerable for digital screens. Its clean lines and balanced letterforms make it easy to read at both small and large sizes, which supports accessibility for all users. The font size is set large enough so that text remains readable even from a distance of about one metre. Color choices meet contrast needs. Important information is not conveyed only by color, but also borders.</p><br><br>
                    <h3>3. User-friendly Design for the Disabled</h3><br>
                    <p>My website is designed to be user-friendly for disabled users by following several accessibility practices. It includes the &quot;lang&quot; and the &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt; declaration to support disabled users by improving how assistive technologies interpret the website. The &quot;lang&quot; attribute allows screen readers to use the correct pronunciation and voice settings, ensuring that blind or low-vision users can clearly understand the content. Meanwhile, the UTF-8 character encoding prevents text from breaking or displaying incorrectly, which helps users with cognitive or reading difficulties follow the content without confusion. The color scheme of my website is also friendly for color-blind users. I avoid relying on red and green contrasts, which are difficult for many users to distinguish, and instead use high-contrast combinations such as blueviolet, cyan, white and gold for the elements, which ensures that people with color-vision deficiencies can still use the website.</p><br><br>
                    <h3>4. How the site works when CSS is off</h3><br>
                    <p>When CSS is turned off, the web pages fall back to the HTML structure:</p><br>
                    <div class="indent">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Layout: The flexbox and the grid will disappear, which makes all the elements the page vertically stacked.</li>
                            <li>Navigation: The navigation menu will not look like buttons, they are only links instead.</li>
                            <li>Colors and Background: All the colors in the stylesheet disappear, leaving the pages with default HTML color of white background and black text.</li>
                            <li>Fonts: Custom fonts will be removed and reverted to the default font of Times New Roman.</li>
                            <li>Table: The tables will lose the border color.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    </div>
                    <p>Without the CSS file, the website remains functional because the semantic HTML ensures that the structure is preserved.</p><br><br>
                    <h3>5. Tabindex</h3><br>
                    <p>The site also supports keyboard navigation by making use of the tabindex attribute. For that reason, users who cannot use mouse can use the tab key to move between the links in the navigation menu and click enter to move to that page. The tab order highlights the focused element, making it clear which link is selected. This feature allows users who do not use mouse to access the website.</p><br><br>
                    <h3>6. Responsiveness on Phone</h3><br>
                    <div class="container1">
                        <div class="textcontainer">
                            <p>The website is designed to be responsive so that users can view it comfortably on both desktop computers and mobile phones. The layout uses flexible CSS grid and flexbox properties that adjust the size and arrangement of elements depending on the screen width. When viewed on a mobile phone, the layout adjusts automatically: the title remains fixed at the top right to highlight the current page, while the navigation bar wraps down onto the next line. This makes the design easier to use on smaller screens, ensuring that the navigation buttons remain visible without overlapping the title. By allowing the elements to wrap and reposition themselves, the site provides a layout that feels organized and user-friendly on mobile phone screen.</p>
                        </div>
                        <img id="phoneweb" src="images/phonepic.jpg" title="My website viewed on mobile phone" alt="My website viewed on mobile phone">
                    </div>
                    <h3>7. Next/Previous Navigation</h3><br>
                    <p>Each page of the website includes Next and Previous buttons at the bottom. These buttons give users a clear and consistent way to move through the site in sequence, without always needing to return to the navigation bar. These buttons can also be used by the Tab key. Moreover, those Next/Previous buttons also support a linear reading path, which is extremely useful for the website. These buttons also use the Roboto font to look synchronized with the navigation menu.</p><br><br>
                </div><br><br>
                <div class="nextprevious">
                    <span><a class="previous" href="future.html">Previous</a></span>
