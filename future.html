                    <p>As a kid, I dreamed of becoming a professional football player because of my deep love for the sport.<br>
                    But as I grew older, I realized that I wasn’t strong or talented enough to pursue that path. Instead, I began to rethink my future and set my sights on becoming a sports analyst, as I also enjoyed analyzing games and breaking down strategies.<br>
                    However, over time I discovered that technology and computing spark my curiosity even more, and now I feel strongly motivated to orient my future toward a career in this field.</p><br><br>

                    <h2>My Aspirations as an International Student</h2><br>
                    <p>Before sharing my aspirations for the future, I would like to first introduce the beautiful place where I was born and raised—Hanoi. As the capital city of Vietnam, Hanoi is full of charm and history, with a unique blend of tradition and modern life. The city is not only beautiful and vibrant but also home to warm and friendly people. Hanoi has offered me wonderful experiences and values that have shaped the person I am today.</p><br><br>

                    <p>Because Hanoi is not only the place where I was born but also the city that has given me countless opportunities and shaped who I am, I carry a deep aspiration to return one day and contribute to its growth, giving back to the place that has given me so much. I aspire to become an analyst who can play a role in advancing the technology and data field of my home country, helping Vietnam grow stronger in the digital era.</p><br><br><br><br>
