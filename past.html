When I was younger, football was what I cared about most, and I spent the majority of my time playing the sport and enjoying every moment on the field. However, after going through a number of injuries, I gradually turned my attention to other areas. That was when I started to develop an interest in technology and computing, which slowly grew into an important part of my life alongside football.</p>

                <p>During my journey of learning how to program, I faced many challenges, with some problems taking me days to solve. There were times when I felt I wasn’t good enough to learn programming. However, my curiosity and determination kept me moving forward, and that persistence is the reason I am still learning and improving my coding skills today.</p>
